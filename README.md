# SWENG-GRAPHICS

Contract Stipulates:

This contract will contain all the tools necessary to implement a professional and coherent Image library that
complies with the project wide standards specified. Each item within the Image library should be accompanied
by comprehensive metadata, including a title, description, creation date and comments. A documented version
control would be ideal if providing revised versions at a later date. Examples of things the Images library should
enable us to do is: define source file (URL) of the image, control the time of (or sequence of) presentation,
control the size and position of the image on screen and the duration the image is on the screen. This contract
should be delivered through a compressed ZIP file with all tools necessary to run the product using Java 11.
Example images (if provided) should be stored using PWS compliant formats.

import javafx.scene.image.Image;
import javafx.scene.image.ImageView;
